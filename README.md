# Controlling-Brightness-of-LED-using-Potentiometer---
This project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer with an Arduino UNO. By connecting the potentiometer to one of the analog input pins of the Arduino, the varying voltage is read and mapped to adjust the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal output on a digital pin connected to the LED. As the knob of the potentiometer is rotated, the LED smoothly dims or brightens according to the analog value read. This setup helps understand the basics of analog input and PWM output in Arduino programming.
